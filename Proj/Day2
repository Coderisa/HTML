/*HTML Attributes
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value" */

Note-The HTML standard does not require quotes around attribute values.  However recommended is "" nad demands quotes for stricter document types like XHTML.
Sometimes you have to use quotes. This example will not display the title attribute correctly, because it contains a space:

Example
<p title=About W3Schools> //only about will be displayed not about W3Schools
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>About W3Schools</h1>
<p title=About W3Schools>
You cannot omit quotes around an attribute value 
if the value contains spaces.
</p>
<p><b>
If you move the mouse over the paragraph above,
your browser will only display the first word from the title.
</b></p>
</body>
</html>

Note-Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.

In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:

<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>
Or vice versa:
<p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">




1)href attribute
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h2>The href Attribute</h2>

<p>HTML links are defined with the a tag. The link address is specified in the href attribute:</p>
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

</body>
</html>

2)src attribute,width and height attribute
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h2>The src Attribute</h2>
<p>HTML images are defined with the img tag, and the filename of the image source is specified in the src attribute:</p>

<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600"> //img is tag ,src is attribute,width,height also attribute specify width and height of image in pixels

</body>
</html>

3)The alt Attribute //learn as alternative
The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.
Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">
Note-If we try to display an image that does not exist, the value of the alt attribute will be displayed instead.

4)The style Attribute
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
Example
<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

5)The lang Attribute
You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.

The following example specifies English as the language:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en"> //<html lang="en-US"> //country codes can also be addedto the language code in the lang attribute
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
6)The title Attribute
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:

Example
<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p> //when we hover over the line "this is ..para." it will show "i am a tooltip
