CSS, 
or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to describe the presentation of a web page written in HTML or XML.
It controls how elements on a web page should be displayed by defining styles such as colors, fonts, layout, and spacing.
CSS helps separate content from design, making it easier to maintain and update web pages.

CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file
