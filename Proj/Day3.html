//HTMl PARAGRAPH
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

note-HTML Display
You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed.
Ex-<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>
This paragraph
contains      a lot of spaces
in the source     code,
but the    browser 
ignores it.
</p>

<p>
The number of lines in a paragraph depends on the size of the browser window. If you resize the browser window, the number of lines in this paragraph will change.
</p>
</body>
</html>

Output-This paragraph contains a lot of spaces in the source code, but the browser ignores it.

2)<hr> tag - Horizontal Rules //learn rule as line
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:

Example                                              
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>

OUTPUT

This is heading 1
This is some text. //no dashed but complete lines
-------------------------------------------------------
This is heading 2
This is some other text.
------------------------------------------------------
This is heading 2
This is some other text.

note-The <hr> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.ie jaha jaha we put <hr> tag vahan vahan lines will show.

3)HTML Line Breaks //learn br as break
The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:

Example
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
OUTPUT
This is
a paragraph
with line breaks.
Note-The <br> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.

4)The Poem Problem
This poem will display on a single line:coz html ignores all the whitespaces and breaks

Example
<p>
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</p>

Solution - The HTML <pre> Element //leanr as preserve element
The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
The <pre> tag in HTML stands for preformatted text. It is used to display text exactly as it is written in the HTML code, preserving all spaces and line breaks. This can be useful for displaying code, poems, or any text where the formatting is important.
Example
<pre>
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>
